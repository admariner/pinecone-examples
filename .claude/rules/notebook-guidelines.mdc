# Notebook Guidelines

Follow comprehensive standards in **`.ai/notebook-standards.md`**.

## Key Principles

**Structure:**
- Start with markdown introduction and prerequisites
- Organize with clear section headers
- End with cleanup cells (if creates resources)

**Code Quality:**
- PEP 8 style, meaningful names, docstrings
- All imports in first code cell
- All dependencies pinned with exact versions

**Documentation:**
- Explain "why" before code
- Keep notebooks focused on single topic

**Execution:**
- Must run cleanly with "Restart Kernel and Run All"
- No hardcoded secrets (use environment variables)

**For complete details:** See **`.ai/notebook-standards.md`**
